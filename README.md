This one-of-a-kind book demonstrates the principles distinctive to managing information technology (IT) projects that extend well beyond standard project management requirements. No book offers more up-to-the minute insights and software tools for IT project management success, including updates that reflect the latest PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, the global standard for managing projects and earning certification. The book weaves today's theory with successful practices for an understandable, integrated presentation that focuses on the concepts, tools, and techniques that are most effective today. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGEMENT is the only book to apply all ten project management knowledge areas to IT projects. You master skills in project integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management as well as all five process groups--initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Intriguing examples from familiar companies featured in today's news, a new Agile case, opportunities with MindView software, and a new chapter on project stakeholder management further ensure you are equipped to manage information technology projects with success. The REVISED Seventh Edition has updated Appendix A for Microsoft Project 2013.
